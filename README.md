# ASCC
ascc is an idiotic programing language inspired by [brainf*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

<hr/>

## Syntax
`f` - go 1 cell forward

`b` - go 1 cell backwards

`p` - increase cell value by 1

`m` - decrease cell value by 1

`o` - print out the array

`i` - get ascii input from user

`s` - start loop

`e` - end loop
- loop will run as long as the current cell != 0
